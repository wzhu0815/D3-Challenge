# D3-Challenge

1.Basics: create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

2. More demographics: Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

3. Incorporate d3-tip:While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmerâ€”we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory.
